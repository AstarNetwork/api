# EVM Precompiled Contract Interfaces

This folder contains the Solidity smart contract interfaces that are implemented on Plasm Network with support for [Frontier EVM Precompile](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/blob/fcae5f8d9ab9cd9dd0ffad3d591264f7dbb8bacc/frame/evm/precompile/simple/src/lib.rs) module.

Todo:

- [ ] compile and expose the contract interface as TypeScript type definitions
